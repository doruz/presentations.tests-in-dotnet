# Introduction in Unit Tests

A **unit test** is a test that exercises individual software components or methods, also known as a "unit of work". Unit tests should only test code within the developer's control. They don't test infrastructure concerns. Infrastructure concerns include interacting with databases, file systems, and network resources.
